/**
 * Attempt an exclusive, nonblocking POSIX flock on the caller's descriptor.
 * The syscall runs in asynchronous work, so acquisition can occur after this
 * call returns. Keep fd open until the promise settles; the binding never
 * opens, duplicates, or closes it. Closing the locked descriptor releases the
 * lock once all descriptors for its open file description are closed.
 * @param fd - Open file descriptor to lock; ownership remains with the caller.
 * @returns A promise resolving to void on acquisition. Contention rejects with
 *   EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK; other syscall failures also reject. Syscall errors carry
 *   code, positive errno, and syscall='flock'. Native setup errors, unsupported
 *   platforms, and addon loading failures reject; importing alone does not load it.
