# User Credentials

English | [中文](credentials.zh.md)

The credential seam of [dsh-credentials](../../packages/credentials/credentials) keeps secrets out of configuration: settings sections and `cordis.yml` entries carry *references* (environment-variable names), providers such as [dsh-credentials-local](../../packages/credentials/credentials-local) own the writable values, and consumers resolve a reference once per operation — the LLM adapters resolve once per model request, so a rotated credential reaches the very next request without any restart. Registered read-only layers may exclusively own selected references supplied by another service. An empty stored value is absent everywhere.

Source: [`packages/credentials/credentials/src/index.ts`](../../packages/credentials/credentials/src/index.ts)

## Identity

A reference names one credential as a POSIX-style environment-variable name. The brand prevents callers from mixing credential references with other strings passed between packages or processes; construction validates the shell-identifier syntax.

```ts type-equiv
/** Nominal reference to one credential: a POSIX-style environment-variable name. */
type CredentialRef = Branded<'CredentialRef'>
```

## Resolution

`resolve(ref)` returns the value with the source layer that supplied it, or `undefined` while unconfigured. Consumers re-resolve at each operation and never cache across operations — that per-operation read is the hot-update mechanism. A reference claimed by a registered read-only layer never falls through to the provider's writable source when that layer returns `undefined` or fails.

```ts type-equiv
/** One resolved credential value and the source layer that supplied it. */
interface ResolvedCredential {
  /** The non-empty secret value. */
  value: string
  /** Provider-defined source layer id (the local provider uses `env`, `file`, `project-env`, and `user-env`). */
  source: string
}
```

## Description

`describe(ref)` answers configuration surfaces without exposing a value: whether the reference resolves, from which layer, and whether `set` would currently succeed. The local provider reports a reference supplied by the live process environment as `writable: false`. Registered read-only layers also report `writable: false`; `set` and `unset` reject while a layer owns the reference.

```ts type-equiv
/** Source and writability facts for one reference, safe for configuration UIs — never the value. */
interface CredentialInfo {
  /** Whether {@link CredentialProvider.resolve} would currently return a value. */
  configured: boolean
  /** Source layer currently supplying the value; absent while unconfigured. */
  source?: string
  /** Whether {@link CredentialProvider.set} would currently succeed for this reference. */
  writable: boolean
}
```

## Read-only layers

A Provider may register disjoint read-only layers whose `owns(ref)` result follows current runtime state. Ownership is exclusive for the complete registration lifetime: reads use only the owning layer, writes reject, and overlapping layer claims fail loud. Disposing the registration releases its claims.

```ts type-equiv
/** One externally supplied read-only credential layer with exclusive reference ownership. */
interface ReadOnlyCredentialLayer {
  /** Stable diagnostic id for registration and write refusals. */
  readonly id: string
  /** Return whether this layer exclusively owns one reference. */
  owns(ref: CredentialRef): boolean
  /** Resolve an owned reference without falling through to the writable Provider source. */
  resolve(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<ResolvedCredential | undefined>
  /** Describe an owned reference without exposing its value. */
  describe(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<CredentialInfo>
}
```

## Change commits

`credentials/updated (ref)` fires after a committed change to a provider-managed source — a `set`, an `unset`, or an external edit observed in storage. Ambient process-environment changes are not observable and never emit. Consumers do not need the event (they re-resolve per operation); it exists for configuration surfaces refreshing a "configured" badge.

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.credentials` — `CredentialProvider` (abstract seam)

Abstract credential service. Providers implement one writable source and may accept disjoint read-only layers. A read-only layer exclusively owns every reference it claims, so resolution never falls through to a personal value and writes reject. An empty stored value is absent everywhere.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one disjoint read-only source layer.
 * @param layer - source ownership, value resolution, and value-free description.
 * @returns an exact-registration disposer.
 */
registerReadOnlyLayer(layer: ReadOnlyCredentialLayer): () => void

/**
 * Resolve one reference to its current value. Resolution is per call:
 * consumers re-resolve at each operation and must not cache across
 * operations — that per-operation read is what makes a changed credential
 * reach the next operation without a restart.
 * @param ref - the reference to resolve.
 * @returns the value and its source, or `undefined` while unconfigured.
 */
async resolve(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<ResolvedCredential | undefined>

/**
 * Describe one reference for configuration surfaces without exposing the
 * value.
 * @param ref - the reference to describe.
 * @returns configured state, supplying source, and writability.
 */
async describe(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<CredentialInfo>

/**
 * Durably store one value in the provider-managed writable source. Rejects
 * while a read-only source shadows the reference — the write would appear
 * to succeed while resolution keeps returning the shadowing value — and
 * rejects an empty value (use {@link unset}).
 * @param ref - the reference to store.
 * @param value - the non-empty secret value.
 */
set(ref: CredentialRef, value: string): Promise<void>

/**
 * Remove one reference from the provider-managed writable source; removing
 * an absent reference is a no-op. Rejects while a read-only source shadows
 * the reference, like {@link set}.
 * @param ref - the reference to remove.
 */
unset(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<void>
```

### `credentials/*` events

<a id="credentialsupdated--emit"></a>

#### `credentials/updated` — emit

Committed change to a provider-managed credential source: a `set`, an `unset`, or an external edit observed in storage. Ambient process-environment changes are not observable and never emit. Listener failures are contained and logged — a sync throw and an async rejection alike — without changing the committed operation's outcome, except `INVARIANT`-coded failures, which rethrow after every listener ran; that rethrow reaches the emitter only from synchronous listeners, so invariant checks on this event must not be async functions.
